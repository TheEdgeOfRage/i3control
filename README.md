# i3Control

A basic android app that controls media functionality on my Linux PC.
This is the first version, so everything is hardcoded and messy.

## Android app

Just change the url to your backend in the `ApiService` class and build the app.

## Python backend

You can run it through wsgi or just directly from the shell using `python run.py`.
The only dependency is [Flask](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask).
